## To make my weather application work I Used OpenWeahermap a third-party API that'll let us fetch the Weather data

This project is an example  Weather-Application that was bulit sample project.mainly using javaSript React css html and using Api for the real time weather fetch the data 

*It will show us the Weather Information of the city in which  we type and clcik search button we will show below result 
            * Weather Condition  
            * temperature
            * Sunset Time
            * humidity
            * Pressure
            * Wind Speed
            * And best Part  icons changes to weather condition
            
## How to install this sample project in your pc 
            * Clone This project
            * Install NodeJs 
            * Open Folder In code editor
